                    <h4>Biography</h4>
                    <br>
                    <p>My name is Elijah liremi,I was born in
                      makhitha village on the 5 November 1989 about 30
                      km western side of Louis trichardt. I am the Last
                      born and only a boy of mother makwarela matia and
                      father mafhungo William liremi, my father from the
                      royal house belonging to the clan of king
                      mapungubwe known as Tshivhula of vhatwanamba
                      nation commonly known as vhadau. Born in the midst
                      of poverty and underdevelopment I did well at
                      primary school (madaheni combined school) and
                      secondary school a(madaheni combined school) and
                      then graduated to university level. Of cause a lot
                      of expectations from my mother who raised us 06
                      children under difficult conditions since her
                      husband died in 1998 when I was doing grade 3 but
                      through the mentorship of my former teacher Mrs
                      mudau known as (alody)I manage to survive and let
                      it go. My life has been of struggle and victory, a
                      bigger challenge to face when one had to study and
                      think of poverty which doesn't only affect you
                      alone , but with the inspiration of my brother
                      takalani Telekisa who manange to exell Without th
                      Availabity of his mother I manange to understand
                      that this too shall pass I remember when my
                      sisters force me to study social worker cause of
                      the poverty we had faced at home I manange to
                      settle for political science cause of the
                      ispriration of Dr phandelani mathoma who was by
                      dat time an ambassador of Mali in south Africa
                      embassy, At university I became part of the
                      progressive youth alliance which i had to fight
                      against students financial exclusion in high
                      education. I grew up within the ranks to become a
                      1prominent leader of sasco, ancyl,ycl and anc and
                      given my family , community background of poverty
                      of cause a staunch communist in fact I joined anc
                      at the age of 15 before I become a member of the
                      Anc under the influence of the late Elias Rantete
                      and by that time he was running to be a ward
                      councilor but due to betrayal he lost to johana
                      nemalengeni, With those young people of my
                      generation cedrick Mokoena, jack Lithole and
                      comrade Jacob khoza who became my friend after The
                      formation of Liremi career foundation, we became
                      found of classics we could read karl marx from the

                      pheubac to lenin, stalin, trosky and rousa
                      luxenberg. Ours was to critique conditions we
                      lived in at time our background and analyse the
                      envisaged noble future of society we would love to
                      see. Under the guidance of great young adults
                      revolutionaries cde vuyani Sokhaba who was
                      2014/2015 president of src at university of the

                      Kutama and late elias Rantete who was direct
                      mentor and blood brother we became part of broader
                      mass democratic movement. At university of the
                      western cape I became close friend with Nwaoko
                      prof Mashao but rather blood brother an academic
                      of Univen rather now a nuclear physics.Having been
                      inspired by leaders in the anc such as president

                      ramatlodi and sello moloto who in my cosas was
                      inspired to meet them, I come from the generation
                      which led us in our early youth the generation of
                      Jackson mirahe, Vuyo Yekani, Tshifhiwa
                      matakala,the late thembi mokgonyana and others. I

                      university of limpopo, losing a young man who was
                      a close friend to my heart was one thing bad,
                      cause a day before his death he said to me now
