                <p>
                  My name is Elijah liremi,I was born in makhitha village on the 5 November 1989 
                  about 30 km western side of Louis trichardt.
                  I am the Last born and only a boy of mother makwarela matia 
                  and father mafhungo William liremi,
                  my father from the royal house belonging to the clan of king mapungubwe known as 
                  Tshivhula of vhatwanamba nation commonly known as vhadau.
                  Born in the midst of poverty and underdevelopment I did well at primary 
                  school (madaheni combined school)  and 
                  secondary school a(madaheni combined school) and 
                  then graduated to  university level. 
                  Of cause a lot of expectations from my mother who raised us 06 
                  children under difficult conditions since her husband died in 1998 
                  when I was doing grade 3 but through the mentorship of my former teacher 
                  Mrs mudau known as (alody)I manage to survive and let it go.
                  My life has been of struggle and victory, 
                  a bigger challenge to face when one had to study and think of poverty which 
                  doesn't only affect you alone ,
                  but with the inspiration of my brother takalani Telekisa who manange to 
                  exell Without th Availabity of his mother I manange to understand that this too shall 
                  pass I remember when my sisters force me to study social worker cause of the poverty 
                  we had faced at home I manange to settle for political science cause of the ispriration 
                  of Dr phandelani mathoma who was by dat time an ambassador of Mali in south Africa embassy, 
                  At  university I became part of the progressive youth alliance which i had to 
                  fight against students financial exclusion in high education.
                  I grew up within the ranks to become a 1prominent leader of sasco, 
                  ancyl,ycl and anc and given my family , community background of poverty of cause a 
                  staunch communist in fact I joined anc at the age of 15 before 
                  I become a member of the Anc under the influence of the late Elias
                  Rantete and by that time he was running to be a ward 
                  councilor but due to betrayal he lost to johana nemalengeni, 
                  With those young people of my generation cedrick Mokoena, 
                  jack Lithole and comrade Jacob khoza who became my friend after 
                   The formation of Liremi career foundation, we became found of classics we could 
                   read karl marx from the beginners, origin of money and family, 
                   thesis on pheubac to lenin, stalin, trosky and rousa luxenberg.
                   Ours was to critique conditions we lived in at time our background and 
                   analyse the envisaged noble future of society we would love to see. 
                   Under the guidance of great young  adults revolutionaries cde vuyani 
                   Sokhaba who was 2014/2015 president of src at university of the western cape, 
                   Jackson mirahe ,norman zwannda Kutama and late elias Rantete who was  direct 
                   mentor and blood brother we became part of broader mass democratic movement. 
                   At university of the western cape I became close friend with Nwaoko 
                   prof Mashao but rather blood brother an academic of Univen rather now a 
                   nuclear physics.Having been inspired by leaders in the anc such as president mbeki, 
                   Joel peter mayibuye netshitendzhe, ngwako ramatlodi and sello moloto who in my cosas was 
                   inspired to meet them, I come from the generation which led us in our early 
                   youth the generation of Jackson mirahe, Vuyo Yekani, 
                   Tshifhiwa matakala,the late thembi mokgonyana and others.
                   I was a prominent member of  Ycl in uwc,sasco  in my university days of cape  Town 
                   and of cause  district committee member of the young communist league of south Africa 
                   Alpheuos malivha district far north of limppopo. 
                   My personal friend I grew up with in my home village phathutshedzo ndouvhada died at 
                   university in his last year of jounalism in the university of limpopo,
                   losing a young man who was a close friend to my heart was one thing bad,
                   cause a day before his death he said to me now that your political science 
                   student the future of the youth belong to you especially makhitha village if 
                   you further need help tell me, after his burial in 2011 I establish liremi career foundation 
                   to help the children of the poor and working class,  Long live the struggle of our 
                   people against hunger and underdevelopment for economic emancipation. We are indid highlighting south African possibilities.
