          <p class="text-justify">
            My name is <strong>Elijah liremi</strong>, I was born in <em>Makhitha</em>
            village on the 5 November 1989 about 30 km western side of <em>Louis
              trichardt</em>.
            I am the Last born and only a boy of mother
            <mark>Makwarela Matia</mark>
            and father
            <mark>Mafhungo William liremi</mark>
            , my father from the royal house belonging to the clan of
            king mapungubwe known as Tshivhula of vhatwanamba nation
            commonly known as vhadau. Born in the midst of poverty and
            underdevelopment I did well at primary school (madaheni
            combined school) and secondary school a(madaheni combined
            school) and then graduated to university level. Of cause a
            lot of expectations from my mother who raised us 06 children
            under difficult conditions since her husband died in 1998
            when I was doing grade 3 but through the mentorship of my
            former teacher Mrs mudau known as (alody)I manage to survive
            and let it go. My life has been of struggle and victory, a
            bigger challenge to face when one had to study and think of
            poverty which doesn't only affect you alone , but with the
            inspiration of my brother takalani Telekisa who manange to
            exell Without th Availabity of his mother I manange to
            understand that this too shall pass I remember when my
            sisters force me to study social worker cause of the poverty
            we had faced at home I manange to settle for political
            science cause of the ispriration of Dr phandelani mathoma
            who was by dat time an ambassador of Mali in south Africa
            embassy, At university I became part of the progressive
            youth alliance which i had to fight against students
            financial exclusion in high education. I grew up within the
            ranks to become a 1prominent leader of sasco, ancyl,ycl and
            anc and given my family , community background of poverty of
            cause a staunch communist in fact I joined anc at the age of
            15 before I become a member of the Anc under the influence
            of the late Elias Rantete and by that time he was running to
            be a ward councilor but due to betrayal he lost to johana
            nemalengeni, With those young people of my generation
            cedrick Mokoena, jack Lithole and comrade Jacob khoza who
            became my friend after The formation of Liremi career
            foundation, we became found of classics we could read karl
            marx from the beginners, origin of money and family, thesis
            on pheubac to lenin, stalin, trosky and rousa luxenberg.
            Ours was to critique conditions we lived in at time our
            background and analyse the envisaged noble future of society
            we would love to see. Under the guidance of great young
            adults revolutionaries cde vuyani Sokhaba who was 2014/2015
            president of src at university of the western cape, Jackson
            mirahe ,norman zwannda Kutama and late elias Rantete who was
            direct mentor and blood brother we became part of broader
            mass democratic movement. At university of the western cape
            I became close friend with Nwaoko prof Mashao but rather
            blood brother an academic of Univen rather now a nuclear
            physics.Having been inspired by leaders in the anc such as
            president mbeki, Joel peter mayibuye netshitendzhe, ngwako
            ramatlodi and sello moloto who in my cosas was inspired to
            meet them, I come from the generation which led us in our
            early youth the generation of Jackson mirahe, Vuyo Yekani,
            Tshifhiwa matakala,the late thembi mokgonyana and others. I
            was a prominent member of Ycl in uwc,sasco in my university
            days of cape Town and of cause district committee member of
            the young communist league of south Africa Alpheuos malivha
            district far north of limppopo. My personal friend I grew up
            with in my home village phathutshedzo ndouvhada died at
            university in his last year of jounalism in the university
            of limpopo, losing a young man who was a close friend to my
            heart was one thing bad, cause a day before his death he
            said to me now that your political science student the
            future of the youth belong to you especially makhitha
            village if you further need help tell me, after his burial
            in 2011 I establish liremi career foundation to help the
            children of the poor and working class, Long live the
            struggle of our people against hunger and underdevelopment
            for economic emancipation. We are indid highlighting south
            African possibilities.
